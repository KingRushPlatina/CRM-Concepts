# Goal: Develop a comprehensive CRM that encompasses all typical CRM system concepts.

In this project, our goal is to create a CRM solution that not only integrates all essential functionalities commonly found in CRM systems but also incorporates additional features to enhance user experience and productivity. We aim to follow a modern architecture approach, utilizing microservices and dependency injection, to ensure scalability, maintainability, and flexibility in our CRM system. We have structured our development process into several phases with detailed goals to achieve this comprehensive CRM solution.

## Phase 1: Backend Development

- [ ] **Create a .NET API with Entity Framework**
  - [ ] Implement CRUD operations for managing clients.
  - [ ] Implement CRUD operations for managing client quotes.
  - [ ] Implement CRUD operations for managing activities related to client quotes.
  - [ ] Ensure proper authentication and authorization mechanisms.

## Phase 2: Frontend Development

- [ ] **Develop the frontend**
  - [ ] Design user interfaces for client management.
  - [ ] Design user interfaces for managing client quotes and related activities.
  - [ ] Implement communication with backend APIs using Angular.
  - [ ] Ensure responsiveness and user-friendly interactions.

## Phase 3: Full-Stack Implementation

- [ ] **Complete a full-stack CRUD**
  - [ ] Test CRUD operations end-to-end to ensure seamless data flow.
  - [ ] Implement validation and error handling mechanisms.
  - [ ] Optimize performance for efficient data retrieval and manipulation.
  - [ ] Implement logging and monitoring functionalities.

## Phase 4: Additional Features

- [ ] **Implement image upload functionality**
  - [ ] Allow users to upload images for activities, client quotes, and clients.
  - [ ] Implement storage solutions for uploaded images (e.g., cloud storage).
  - [ ] Ensure proper handling of image file formats and sizes.
  - [ ] Implement image preview and management features.

## Phase 5: Testing and Deployment

- [ ] **Test the application thoroughly**
  - [ ] Conduct unit tests for backend APIs and frontend components.
  - [ ] Perform integration tests to ensure seamless interaction between frontend and backend.
  - [ ] Conduct user acceptance testing (UAT) to gather feedback and make necessary adjustments.
- [ ] **Deploy the CRM solution**
  - [ ] Choose a suitable hosting environment (e.g., cloud platform or self-hosted server).
  - [ ] Configure deployment pipelines for automated deployment.
  - [ ] Monitor deployed application for performance, security, and stability.
